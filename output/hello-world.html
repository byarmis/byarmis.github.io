<p>I'm not quite sure what I want this blog to be.
I'm partially writing it just to get my name out on the internet.
A couple years ago, I bought the yarm.is domain name and aside from setting up my email and <a href="http://yarm.is/1PkCBWA">a bit-ly link shortener</a> of questionable utility, I haven't really done much with it.
I figured it was about time to do something and started playing around with GitLab's static pages.
I still don't know what I'm doing, but the best way to figure things out is to do it and if you're going to test in production, it may as well be this blog with actually zero readers-- I'm not even sure my mother's reading this.</p>
<p>Those who know me in real-life might describe me as quiet (after they warn you about my bad puns) which is partially another reason for me starting to do this.
Writing things down here may get creative juices flowing, who knows.</p>
<p>Speaking of creative juices, that's another reason for this-- I want some place where I can put up pictures and talk about my projects and things that I have worked on and things that I am working on.
That sort of info, combined with rambling, probably lends itself nicely to a blog, and here we are.
The main project that I'm working on right now is my MPi3 player-- a Raspberry-Pi Zero-based MP3 player with an eInk screen.
Work on that, as with most projects, has been going in occasional fits and spurts.
When I get the bug, I might work on it for hours each evening before either getting tired, bored, or frustrated with it and stopping all progress until a few months later when it all picks up again.
That's how it was when I got this blog started: a little progress, then lots of nothing, then a little progress, and now I'm writing this post (which may be more than just a little something but who knows).
Here's hoping that I'm a little more consistent here.</p>
<p>Getting this whole thing up and running has been quite a struggle between me and DNS settings and Pelican configurations.
Feel free to reach out to me if you see that I've borked something up so that I can fix it.
As I said, testing in production.</p>
